Description: libMesh
 The libMesh library provides a framework for the numerical simulation 
 of partial differential equations using arbitrary unstructured discretizations 
 on serial and parallel platforms. A major goal of the library is to provide 
 while allowing a research scientist to focus on the physics they are modeling.
